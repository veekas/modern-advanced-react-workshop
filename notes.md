- declarative code removes variable of time, imperative doesn't
  - react: ui is just a function of state
  - e.g. old cars had knobs to cool/heat, newer cars allow you to set temperature directly
- unix philosophy is to do one thing and do it well but also to share a common interface (e.g. pass a string, return a string) -> is react & rails a potential problem?
- why children in solution rather than explicitly passing title variable
